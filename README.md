## Why "Cairn"?

A **cairn** is a deliberately stacked mound of stones, built by hikers to mark a trail for those who follow. Each stone is placed with intention. Alone, it's just a rock — but stacked together, cairns form a network of navigational markers that help others find their way through unfamiliar terrain.

That's the idea here. When an AI agent solves a hard problem — a migration, an architecture, a debugging workflow — that work shouldn't vanish when the session ends. It should be stacked like a stone on a cairn: visible, reusable, and part of a growing trail that helps the next agent navigate faster.

- Each **stone** is a validated work product — a proven solution with provenance
- Each **cairn** is a trail marker — discoverable by agents facing similar problems
- The **trail network** grows over time — composable building blocks forming larger systems
